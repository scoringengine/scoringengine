## Getting started

Download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview). If you are on Mac or Windows, [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) will be automatically installed. On Linux, make sure you have the latest version of [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). If you're using [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) on Windows 10 pro or later, you must also [switch to Linux containers](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers).

Run in this directory:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

If you want to delete the database before starting, set the SCORINGENGINE_OVERWRITE_DB environment variable:

```
SCORINGENGINE_OVERWRITE_DB=true docker-compose up
```

We also provide the ability to run it in an 'example' mode. This means only the web ui runs, and the database is prepopulated with example data. Set the SCORINGENGINE_EXAMPLE environment variable to true:

```
SCORINGENGINE_EXAMPLE=true docker-compose up
```

The app will be running at [http://localhost](http://localhost)

Log in with any of the following logins at http://localhost:

- whiteteamuser:testpass
- team1user1:testpass
- team2user1:testpass
- team2user2:testpass
- redteamuser:testpass
