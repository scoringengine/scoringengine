Getting started
---------------

Download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview). If you are on Mac or Windows, [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) will be automatically installed. On Linux, make sure you have the latest version of [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). If you're using [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) on Windows 10 pro or later, you must also [switch to Linux containers](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers).

Run in this directory:
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

If you want to delete the database before starting, set the OVERWRITE_DB environment variable:
```
OVERWRITE_DB=true docker-compose up
```

We also provide the ability to run it in an 'example' mode. This means only the web ui runs, and the database is prepopulated with example data. Set the EXAMPLE environment variable to true:
```
EXAMPLE=true docker-compose up
```

The app will be running at [http://localhost](http://localhost)

Log in with any of the following logins at http://localhost:
* whiteteamuser:testpass
* team1user1:testpass
* team2user1:testpass
* team2user2:testpass
* redteamuser:testpass
