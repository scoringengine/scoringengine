"""Utility helpers for preparing the integration test database.

The real scoring engine is normally backed by MySQL and populated through a
number of external services.  The integration tests in this repository run in
isolation, so we create a minimal yet representative dataset backed by SQLite.
This module is imported by the integration tests during collection time to
ensure the database schema exists and contains deterministic data.
